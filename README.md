My smart thermostat is no longer as smart. Radio Thermostat a product available in many big box stores at lower cost than the competetion, marketed by 2M Filtrete, has lost its backend cloud support. The provider no doubt cannot earn a profit by providing a free service. The electronics continue to function well as a manual wall thermostat, but this defeats the purpose of having a "smart" device without remote access. This is my journey to regain remote access to the device and restore the ability to manage it remotely. There is hope, people have done it and the device has a REST API. 

I have Hubitat and I have stood up an instance of Home Assistant (now decommissioned). Research both of these pathways as well as simply controlling the device with my own internal REST server.
